        Hello, World! I am Oyster. I was born and raised in Melaka, Malaysia. A
        city where full of heritage and tasty food. Also, I am a father of a son
        and a daughter.

        You might be curious why I am called Oyster. My Chinese name is ÂçáÂ£ï,
        which pinyin is the same as Oyster in Chinese, and my friends think it
        is easier to remember, so I have used it since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was 13, I used HTML and Adobe Flash to create a website for fun,
        and this passion carried me until today. I am a full-stack engineer with
        over 5 years of working experience in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming
        languages and problem-solving. So far, I have TypeScript, VueJS,
        ReactJS, NodeJS, SvelteJS, NestJS, ViteJS, Go under my belt. I am still
        enthusiastically exploring other programming languages, frameworks, or
        principles that I can integrate with my coding.
