## Introduction
In 2019, I had a dream with my ex-company. Improve Malaysia‚Äôs tech community by writing tech articles. However, I kept asking myself: ‚ÄúAm I perfect enough to share my knowledge?‚Äù In the end, I didn‚Äôt publish a single article.

Until **June 2021**, I saw two books recommended by a Youtuber [ËÄÅÁü≥Ë∞àËäØ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5mVFJf71Ax6TJZcbmTnilw)

1. [Show Your Work!](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) by Austin Kleon
2. [Soft Skills: The software developer‚Äôs life manual](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397) by John Sonmez

After reading both of these books, I published my first article in **Aug 2021**.

## You don‚Äôt have to be a genius to share your knowledge.
I spoke with one of my friends about ViteJS and PNPM, and he told me none of his colleagues or superiors knows about these. He thanked me for boosting his team‚Äôs development speed.

I realize many people out there might not know about these libraries, and it could be life-changing. Then, the article was born.

## Share something small and valuable every day/week.
Share something that you think it will help at least one person. It‚Äôs not a must to share on Medium; you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube etc.

For example:
1. [@nickbulljs's Twitter](https://twitter.com/nickbulljs/status/1371347011077832704)
2. [Simple Javascript Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/simpleJavascript)
3. [Fireship Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship)

However, please don‚Äôt turn it into human spam.

## Teach people what you know
Teaching people doesn‚Äôt subtract value from what you do; it adds to it.

When I was 16, my bookkeeping subject consistently scored full marks. My teacher always wants me to teach my classmates during class. If I failed to explain, she punished me, and she said: **"If you able to teach someone and able to make him understand, it means you fully understand it."**

**‚ÄúWhile you are teaching, you also learning.‚Äù**

Sometimes you face some challenges, and you got your solution which you can‚Äôt find online. Please share with others because people might be having the same issue as you, but they can‚Äôt figure it out.

## Criticism is good
Do not fear haters. They are your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who care about your work.

In [Ultralearning by Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/), he believes that feedback can guide future learning. If one criticism your work, which is good for you because you know which part you can improve.

## But why should I share my knowledge?
1. **Portfolio and self-branding** ‚Äî Sharing your knowledge through platforms can be your portfolio and self-branding. When times come, jobs find you instead of you find jobs.
2. **Learning** ‚Äî You learning while teaching. When receiving criticism, you learn.
3. **Passive Income** ‚Äî Writing an article on a platform like Medium can generate passive income for you. By joining [Medium Partner Program](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187) or [Affiliate Marketing Program](https://medium.com/trapica/affiliate-marketing-a-step-by-step-guide-539d5c2f11a8)

Unlike Western, most of the Asian doesn‚Äôt like to contribute to the tech community, by sharing knowledge, open-sourcing, meetups, etc. I hope one day, Asians and Westerns can be equal, both having a solid tech community.

Let‚Äôs build a better tech community!
